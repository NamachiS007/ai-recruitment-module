## Features

### 1. Add New Job

**Location:** `Recruiting > Add New Job`

Allows HR administrators to create job vacancies with rich metadata and AI-assisted job descriptions.

#### Form Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Job Title | Text | ✅ | Official position name |
| Department | Dropdown | ✅ | Linked to `org_departments` |
| Position Type | Dropdown | ✅ | Full-time / Part-time / Contract |
| Experience | Text | ✅ | Format: `"X-Y years"` |
| Work Type | Dropdown | ✅ | On-site / Remote / Hybrid |
| Location | Text | ❌ | Office or city |
| Salary Range | Dual Input | ❌ | Min and Max (numeric) |
| No. of Positions | Number | ✅ | Headcount quota |
| Job End Date | Date Picker | ✅ | Must be ≥ current date |

#### AI-Assisted Job Description

- Users provide a **custom prompt** (e.g., *"Focus on React experience and soft skills"*)
- `[Generate Job Description]` triggers a call to the LLM backend
- Output is rendered in a **WYSIWYG Rich Text Editor** (Quill / CKEditor)

#### Resume Parsing Threshold

A slider (0–100%) that sets the minimum AI match score for a candidate to pass initial screening. Candidates scoring below this threshold are automatically flagged.

> **Default:** `50%` — stored as an integer in the database.

#### Validation Rules

- `Job End Date >= Current Date`
- `Max Salary >= Min Salary`
- No negative values for numeric fields
- `[Preview & Save]` triggers a summary modal before committing to DB

**Location:** `Recruiting > Manage Jobs`

Central dashboard for monitoring all active and archived job postings.

#### Search & Filter

#### LinkedIn Job Publishing

The **Publish** tab inside the Job Configuration modal allows recruiters to push finalized job postings directly to LinkedIn via the **LinkedIn Marketing Developer Platform**, expanding vacancy reach to a wider professional audience instantly.

       ↓
2. Recruiter clicks [Publish Job]
       ↓
3. User redirected to LinkedIn OAuth login (new tab)
       ↓

#### Data Grid
